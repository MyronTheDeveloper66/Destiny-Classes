         <p class="description">Warlocks have long studied The Traveler, which gives rise to their ability to harness some of its powers. As the Warlocks advance through levels, their arcane powers grow stronger. In appearance, Warlocks can be distinguished by their rounded helmets and long vestments. As with the other player classes, in addition to head, chest armor, gauntlets, and leg armor, they have a special fifth armor slot that is unique to their class and further helps to distinguish them from their brethren in arms: a bond (armband) worn on the upper-left arm.</p>
