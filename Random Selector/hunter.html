         <p class="description">Through manipulation of the Traveler's energies, Hunters learned how to survive in the wild. This heritage has led to their characteristic tendency of bending the rules to suit their particular situation. Being the trailblazers amongst Guardian classes, Hunters serve as invaluable scouts when surveying hostile and dangerous territory combining their trademark daring and ingenuity. Hunters can be easily distinguished in-game by their signature hooded cloaks, thin builds, and lightly armored outfits.</p>
